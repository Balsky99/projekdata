Sanbercode Bootcamp

This project aims to classify a person's income as over 5 million or under 5 million. 
I use the neural network model to predict these cases. 
Obtained a prediction accuracy of around 91% (ranked 14th on Leaderbord Kaggle)

the description of the output is as follows:
0 : Salary <= 5 million - 1 : Salary >  5 million
